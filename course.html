					<h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
					<p>It was in 1955 the Institute of Public and Business Administration (IPBA) was established, making it one of the oldest business school outside North America. Initial technical support was provided by the world famous Wharton School of Finance, University of Pennsylvania. Soon after the University of Southern California set up various facilities at the Institute and several prominent American professors were assigned to the IBA. The course contents, the curriculum, the pedagogical tools and the assessment and testing methods were developed under the guidance of reputed scholars from these two institutions. IBA has zealously guarded the high standards and academic traditions it had inherited from Wharton and USC while adapting and adjusting them with the passage of time</p>

					<p>In 1956 a two-year MBA morning program commenced as a constituent unit of the University of Karachi. Faculty was hired in the department of Public and Business Administration, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania and assisted by United States International Corporation Administration, now USAID. In 1957, a two-year MBA evening program was launched to cater to the needs of numerous working executives and managers who were interested in furthering their careers through part-time business studies.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Faculty of Computer Science was originally established as the Center for Computer Studies in 1983 with the collaboration of IBM, Pakistan. It initially offered a PGD in System Analysis along with a two-year MBA (MIS) program to overcome a shortage of software professionals in the country. It now offers BS (Computer Science), MS (Computer Science), and PhD programs. It was in 1989 the PGD (System Analysis) program was upgraded to a two-year MBA (MIS) program.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC) was established in 2011 under the guidelines from HEC with the aim to become the backbone of the country's policy makers by providing sound academic expertise. Applied research at the Institute not only facilitates the decision-making bodies, NGOs, transnational organizations, and businesses but also transforms an idea into a scholarly project. The IBA Karachi wants to set a standard of excellence and outline new frontiers in research. ORIC strives to provide a culture, infrastructure and environment that encourages and supports the IBA community.</p>
